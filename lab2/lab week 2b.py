#Write a for loop that prints this pattern:
#HINT: you can write a for-loop inside of a for-loop

#turn it into [1,    2,   3, 4   ]  
#NOTE:  The spacing is just to show which numbers are converted to which
#HINTS: There are three steps here: mapping, filtering, and flattening the nested lists
#       Try doing this in a for-loop, then try doing it in a list comprehension
#       You may need to check StackOverflow for how to flatten a nested list

#HINTS: The datetime library has a function that turns strings of the right format into dates
#       Again, start with a for-loop, but make a dictionary comprehension in the end
